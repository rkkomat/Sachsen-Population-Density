# Sachsen-Population-Density


This repository contains the code and output files for a 3D visualization depicting population density in the state of Sachsen/Saxony in Germany. 

The required dataset, which provides population density information for various regions within Sachsen/Saxony, is available for download from the Kontur website at the following link: https://data.humdata.org/dataset/kontur-population-dataset. 
The dataset is provided in geopackage format with a '.gpkg' extension, but can be downloaded as a compressed file with a '.gpkg.gz' extension. 
Remember to decompress the file and save it with a '.gpkg' extension in order to use it for this project. 
All necessary libraries and packages are included in the code.
